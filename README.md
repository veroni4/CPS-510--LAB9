## SQLite3
SQLite was used to create a local database `local.db` that was used in this project.
`sqlite3` is a built-in module in Python and provides a standard DB-API 2.0 interface for interacting with SQLite databases. 
It is serverless, light-weight and self-contained, making it really easy to use.
